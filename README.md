# GEOG5995M - Second Assignment

## SHORT DESCRIPTION:
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (Bomb_model.ipynb) which describes the development process of an interactive dispersion model. The model estimates how particles are dispersed by the wind if a bomb is set off on top of a building. The model also allows the user to specify the parameters of the model by controlling sliders. 

## OUTPUTS:
- Visualisation of the particle density on the ground.
- A text file cointaining the particle density after a full model run.

## ISSUES:
I tried to deploy a version on the cloud, either as a HTML with a frame or as a rendered Notebook both using a remote kernel (i.e. myblender.org). However, I failed to produce a functional version of the interactive section.
